SquareTools
I live in a gated development in London consisting of 114 Live/Work duplex residential units called "Red Square". 
The residents creating enough critical mass to promote the inter-provision of services within the working community, 
sharing, nice neighbourhood, a lot of families with kids. 

I am learning a full stack developer. I need to build something utilising Python and SQLite. The scope should not be 
too complex, but still I hope it is useful and ideally building up on this potential of having a lot of engaged neighbours, 
professionals, families in the Red Square.

Resource Sharing Platform
An application to facilitate the sharing of resources among residents: starting with sharing tools, appliances, or other equipment.
Later we potentially I can build car pooling / neighbourhood.
