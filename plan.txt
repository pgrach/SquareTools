SquareTools
I live in a gated development in London consisting of 114 Live/Work duplex residential units called "Red Square". 
The residents creating enough critical mass to promote the inter-provision of services within the working community, 
sharing, nice neighbourhood, a lot of families with kids. 

I am learning a full stack developer. I need to build something utilising Python and SQLite. The scope should not be 
too complex, but still I hope it is useful and ideally building up on this potential of having a lot of engaged neighbours, 
professionals, families in the Red Square.

Resource Sharing Platform
An application to facilitate the sharing of resources among residents: starting with sharing tools, appliances, or other equipment.
Later we can potentially build a car pooling system amongst neighbours.

TO DO LIST:

(1) DONE_"Add Items" and "View All Items" should be grouped under a "Items" dropdown menu. But if i group them, then there is just one link in the navbar.
(2) So far the focus is on items sharing/borrowing which is the most important. Maybe as a next step I could add platform members statistics: borrowing activity, times borrowed, nr of items stored,
(3) adding a footer for additional links or information (maybe description of "good sharing practices"?)
(4) "Go BACK to MAIN MENU" link can be integrated into the main navigation bar
(5) Table navigation: Using icons or color coding help users identify borrowed and available items quickly.
(6) Actions buttons UI for return/borrow/add to enhance with color or icons.
(7) DONE_Add My Items (which is basically search selecting flat number)
(8) Optimization: As the platform grows, might consider lazy loading images or paginating the "View All Items" page to ensure faster load times.
